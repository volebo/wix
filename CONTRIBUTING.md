## Issues

In case you read this because you are posting an issue, please take a minute and conside the things below. The issue tracker is not a support forum. It is primarily intended to submit bugs, improvements or feature requests.

* Use the search function. Chances are that your problem is already discussed. Do not append to (closed) issues if your problem does not fit the discussion.
* ~~Visit the [Troubleshooting](../../wiki/TroubleShooting) wiki first.~~
* Use [proper formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). Paste your logs in code blocks.
* Close your issue if you resolved it.

## Pull Requests
If you think you can contribute code to any of Volebo.Net projects, do not hesitate to submit a pull request.

### Branches

We use **Git Flow** branching strategy. Read more: [en](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/), [ru](https://habrahabr.ru/post/106912/), or just use [cheatsheet](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)

All pull requests should be based on the `develop` branch, to minimize cross merges. When you want to develop a new feature, clone the repository with `git clone origin/develop -b FEATURE_NAME`. Use meaningful commit messages.
